description: About the process of adding docs for your change to the Astro codebase.

Docs are part of the "definition of done" for Astro!

When you contribute to the Astro codebase, you will be required to provide some form of documentation about the effect your changes have for the community of Astro builders.

Even [patch changes](/docs-for-code-changes/patch-changes/) to Astro require a [**changeset**](/docs-for-code-changes/changesets/): a Markdown document that states which repository has changed, and a message describing the change that will be publicly displayed on the repo's CHANGELOG.

For more significant changes that affect how people use Astro, you must also describe any change in usage as a result of your contribution, as well as introduce and explain any new features.

This section provides guidance on how to document your contribution so that people can find, understand, and apply any changes in their project accordingly.
